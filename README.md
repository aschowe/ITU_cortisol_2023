# ITU_cortisol_2023
Analysis code used to produce main and supplementary results of the manuscript: "Diurnal Cortisol Profiles across 9,356 Salivary 
Samples during Pregnancy â€“ Associations with Maternal Cardiometabolic Complications"

## 01_ITU_sample_characteristics
Descriptive comparisons displayed in Table 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1 and 2

## 02A_ITU_CARmodel_Selection
Analysis code used to determine random structure of the basic CAR model. Results of these 
analyses are shown in supplemental methods Table 1, supplemental  results Table 3, and Table 3. 
The latter table summarises the final CAR model.   

## 02B_ITU_CARmodel_Effects
Analysis code used to investigate the effect of metabolic adversity on CAR. Results of this 
analysis are shown in Table 5, and supplemental results table 5. 

## 03A_ITU_Diurnalmodel_Selection
Analysis code used to determine random structure of the basic DCS model. Results of these
analyses are shown in supplemental methods Table 2, supplemental  results Table 5, and Table 5.  
The latter table summarises the final DCS model.

## 03B_ITU_Diurnalmodel_Effects
Analysis code used to investigate the effect of metabolic adversity on CAR. Results of this
analysis are shown in Table 6 and supplemental results, table 6.

## 04_ITU_stratified_analyses
Stratified analyses for BMI >=25 vs BMI < 25. 

## 05A_posthoc_analyses_ALYS_AUCi
Additional CAR descriptive in non-pregnant women assessed with the same collection protocol as 
our study. Results shown in supplemental results, table 10.

## 05B_posthoc_analyses_intramural_CAR
Additional CAR descriptive in external, independent pregnant sample. Results are descripted 
in-text. 

## 05C_CAR_comparisons
Demographic comparisons between women with and without expected CAR pattern. Results are shown 
in supplemental results, Table 7-9. 
 
## 06_ITU_cortPlots
Code for Figure 1,2, and 3. 

## ITU_lmm_helper_functions.R
Function applied in several scripts including formatting output in nice table format, ICC 
function etc. Basis for ICC function is explained in the supplemental methods.
